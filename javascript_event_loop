The Javascript event loop is the system which allows the single threaded language 
to execute asychronous code in a non blocking fashion.  When an asynchronous function is 
passed onto the callstack, it's callback is placed into a separate thread (web APIs in 
the browser, not sure in node) which executes the asynchronous call.  When that call
resolves it passes the resolved value to the callback.  The callback is then added to a
task queue and passed onto the callstack to be executed when the callstack is clear.
